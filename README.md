# Gravwell Public Roadmap

Our [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/gravwell/projects/4/views/1) is where you can view the status of upcoming features that we have planned. This plan is just an overview of some of the features, but it is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all planned work. 

If you have questions or there are other features that you would like to see added to the roadmap, please join the discussion in our [Discord Community Support](https://discord.com/invite/gravwell) channels. We have a dedicated channel for feature-request.
